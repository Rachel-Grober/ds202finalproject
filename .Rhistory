#To begin, I began exploring the relationship between the sale  price and the living area size by identifying that they were positively correlated. As a result, I can conclude that as a houses living area increase, its sales price will also increase. Since the r-value I calculated was larger than .7, this means that these two variables have a strong relationship. In addition, I created a scatter plot to help me visualize this data and added a line to help fit it. I notice that the line gradually slopes upward, showing us that as living area size increases, so does sales price.
```
#Question 2
```{r}
#One anomaly I found in the previous plot are the two outliers that have the largest amount of living area, yet their price decreases significantly.My hypothesis for this is that people generally don't need or prefer having that much space in their house. As a result the demand is for them is lower, which decreases the price of the house. The second anomaly I found is that without those two outliers, the slope of the line would be more abruptly upward sloping, thus having a better fit to our data.
